# LanguageGuesser

This is a basic application I've created while learning Node JS & NPM.
app.js file uses franc and langs packages to guess the language you've typed.
franc package accepts a string for guessing a language. After the guess it outputs a 3 digit according to ISO language standards.
langs pakacage accepts the ISO output from franc as input and outputs the language.
